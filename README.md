## Julia Set Visualizer

A simple Julia set visualizer application.

By clicking in the plot area where the Mandelbrot set is displayed, the corresponding complex point *c* is selected and the Julia set for *f(z) = z^2 + c* is displayed in the other plot area. By dragging on the Julia set plot, an area is selected and the the zoomed in version of the plot is produced. The deselection is achieved with a single click.

The coordinates of the mouse position and the selected points can be shown or hidden via the designated toggle button.

Math mode allows to selected a point *z* in both the Mandelbrot and Julia set plots and trace its path during the construction algorithm.

The number of max iterations can also be changed. If set too high, a warning signal is displayed.
